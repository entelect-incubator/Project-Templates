# .NET Backend Templates

Production-ready backend templates for .NET applications following industry best practices and architectural patterns.

## Overview

This directory contains three distinct architectural patterns for building scalable, maintainable .NET backend applications. Each template represents a different approach to organizing code and managing dependencies, allowing you to choose the pattern that best fits your project's needs.

## 📁 Available Templates

### 1. Layered Architecture
**Directory:** `1.LayeredArchitecture/`

A pragmatic approach to organizing code into logical layers with clear separation of concerns.

**Best For:**
- Projects requiring quick startup
- Teams with varying experience levels
- When flexibility in technology choices per layer is important
- Well-defined project scope

**Architecture Layers:**
- **Presentation Layer** - API controllers and HTTP concerns
- **Application Layer** - Business logic and use cases
- **Domain Layer** - Core business rules and entities
- **Data Access Layer** - Database interactions (optional)
- **Infrastructure Layer** - External dependencies and cross-cutting concerns

**Advantages:**
- ✅ Simple to understand and implement
- ✅ Easy team onboarding
- ✅ Clear separation of concerns
- ✅ Flexible technology choices per layer
- ✅ Fast development iteration

**When Not to Use:**
- ❌ Projects with complex, long-term architectural requirements
- ❌ Need for strict dependency rules
- ❌ Multiple independent teams working on different areas

**Key Features:**
- Clean Template (DbContext as UnitOfWork) - ✨ Recommended
- Optional DataAccess Layer for additional abstraction
- Includes database migrations
- Example CRUD operations

---

### 2. Clean Architecture
**Directory:** `2.CleanArchitecture/`

Strict separation of concerns with well-defined dependency direction, pioneered by Robert C. Martin.

**Best For:**
- Large, complex applications
- Projects with evolving requirements
- Long-term maintenance is critical
- Multiple teams requiring clear boundaries

**Architecture Layers:**
- **Domain Layer** - Enterprise business logic and entities
- **Application Layer** - Use cases and business logic
- **Infrastructure Layer** - Technical implementations
- **Presentation Layer** - API controllers and web concerns

**Principles:**
- Independent of frameworks
- Testable independently
- Independent of UI
- Independent of database
- Independent of any external agency

**Advantages:**
- ✅ Strict architectural boundaries
- ✅ Framework-agnostic design
- ✅ Highly testable code
- ✅ Long-term maintainability
- ✅ Clear dependency direction (inward)
- ✅ Easy to replace components

**When Not to Use:**
- ❌ Small projects where overhead is excessive
- ❌ Teams that need quick development without structure
- ❌ Project scope requires frequent architectural changes

**Key Features:**
- Clear dependency direction (all arrows point inward)
- Repository pattern implementation
- CQRS pattern support with MediatR
- Comprehensive abstraction layers
- Advanced testing patterns

---

### 3. Vertical Slice Architecture
**Directory:** `3.VerticalSliceArchitecture/`

Organizes code by features rather than technical layers, enabling end-to-end feature delivery.

**Best For:**
- Agile and iterative development
- Rapid feature delivery needed
- Cross-functional teams
- Projects where features are relatively independent

**Organization:**
- Each feature is a complete vertical slice
- Slices contain all layers (UI, business logic, data access)
- Features can evolve independently
- Shared infrastructure for cross-cutting concerns

**Advantages:**
- ✅ Rapid feature delivery
- ✅ Holistic understanding of features
- ✅ Reduced integration challenges
- ✅ Cross-functional collaboration
- ✅ Independent feature development
- ✅ Flexibility in technology per feature
- ✅ Faster feedback loops

**When Not to Use:**
- ❌ Highly coupled business logic across features
- ❌ Need for strict architectural consistency
- ❌ Small team with limited experience

**Key Features:**
- Feature-based folder structure
- CQRS pattern with MediatR
- Independent feature handlers
- Shared infrastructure utilities
- Event-driven communication between features

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

1. **.NET 9 SDK** - [Download](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download)
   - Check your version: `dotnet --version`

2. **Git** - For version control

3. **IDE** - Visual Studio, VS Code, or Rider

4. **SQL Server / PostgreSQL** (optional) - For database setup

### Step-by-Step Setup

#### 1. Choose Your Template

```bash
# Choose one of these directories based on your needs:
# - 1.LayeredArchitecture/      (Recommended for most projects)
# - 2.CleanArchitecture/        (For complex, long-term projects)
# - 3.VerticalSliceArchitecture/ (For agile, feature-driven projects)
```

#### 2. Copy the Template

```bash
# Option A: Copy the template to a new location
cp -r 1.LayeredArchitecture ../MyNewProject
cd ../MyNewProject

# Option B: Clone the repository and work with the template
git clone https://github.com/entelect-incubator/Project-Templates.git
cd Project-Templates/backend/.NET/1.LayeredArchitecture
```

#### 3. Install Dependencies

```bash
# Restore NuGet packages
dotnet restore
```

#### 4. Configure the Application

- Edit `appsettings.json` with your configuration
- Update connection strings for your database
- Configure any external services

#### 5. Database Setup (if using)

```bash
# Update connection string in appsettings.json
# Then run migrations (if applicable)
dotnet ef database update
```

#### 6. Run the Application

```bash
# Development
dotnet run

# With hot reload
dotnet watch run
```

The API will be available at `https://localhost:7000` by default.

#### 7. Explore the API

- Swagger UI: `https://localhost:7000/swagger/index.html`
- OpenAPI JSON: `https://localhost:7000/swagger/v1/swagger.json`
